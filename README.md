# YOLOv1 Object Detection Paper from scratch using Pytorch
In this Project, I implement ***`YOLOv1 Object Detection Paper`*** from scratch using Pytorch.\
\
***`Dataset`***: Cat and Dog Object Detection Dataset provided by Roboflow: \
https://public.roboflow.com/ds/B1cLXyUA5l?key=0E7jZ1cq7I . \
This contains around 3000 images and corresponding annotations.

***`Experiments Performed`***:
1) Training the model from scratch
2) Finetuning the last layers by replacing the backbone with vgg16 pretrained model

The results of above two are provided in the pdfs, along with the explaination of the code.

***`References`***:
